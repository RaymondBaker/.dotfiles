Jul 02 21:30:27 <ishitatsuyuki>	I don't think it's possible with block

Jul 02 21:34:37 <ishitatsuyuki>	Probably you are correct. What's your goal though?
Jul 02 21:35:05 <isHavvy>	Decent example for the reference.

Jul 02 21:38:59 <isHavvy>	Grr, it deleted what I did.
Jul 02 21:39:39 <sinclair>	Mutabah: sorry, having some trouble understanding this GenericArray, are you able to provide some assistance?

Jul 02 21:40:22 <sinclair>	these crypto libraries take a dependency on a GenericArray, which is used to pass an initialization vector of "known" size

Jul 02 21:40:56 <sinclair>	i have a IV which is currently of type [u8; 32], but not entirely sure how this should map to a generic array.
Jul 02 21:42:22 <Mutabah>	No idea, sorry
Jul 02 21:42:23 <Ralith>	there's a `from_slice` method or something like that
